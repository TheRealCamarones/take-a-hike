# take-a-hike

A group project for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. Using mySQL, an Express server, and the Sequelize ORM we created an interface for users to search for hiking trails in the Great Smokey Mountains, save that trail to their user trails, and then add gear to a list of items they need to bring with them.
